# simplestAudioJS
An extremely simple demo of audiocontext and synthesis of audio in js.

This is a hello world like application to show the most basic things needed to generate sounds using AudioContext, with comments to let you know what each line does. There are very few unnecesary lines, and they are indicated as such.

I created this to give people a most basic starting point for AudioContext, as the other tutorials I found had much more complexity than necessary to get started with AudioContext. This is just seven lines.
